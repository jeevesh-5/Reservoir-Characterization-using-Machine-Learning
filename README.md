# Reservoir-Characterization-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains a project focused on applying machine learning techniques to reservoir characterization in the oil and gas industry. The goal is to utilize well log and seismic data for predicting rock facies and estimating subsurface properties like porosity and permeability.

Features:
Preprocessing and visualization of well log and seismic data.
Facies classification using algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Visualization of facies distribution and reservoir properties.
Insights to aid exploration and production strategies.
